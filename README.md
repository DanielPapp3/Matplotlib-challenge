# Matplotlib-challenge

This repo contains the results of an analysis on a hypothetical drug trial obtained using a variety of Python libraries including matplotlib. The data sets were supplied by the instructors and can be found in the form of two CSV files within the "data" folder located inside the "Pymaceuticals" folder within this repository.

The objective of the analysis was to generate the tables and figures relating to the findings for use in the technical reports of the clinical study. You can find the results of this analysis by navigating to the file entitled "Pymaceuticals.ipynb" located in the "Matplotlib/Pymaceuticals" folder within this repository.
